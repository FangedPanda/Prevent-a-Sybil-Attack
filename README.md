# Prevent-a-Sybil-Attack-in-wireless-sensor-network-using-random-key-pre-distribution.
This project is a simulation of sensor nodes in real world(although it only takes into account the important part of real world).In this project we prevent a sybil attack by communicating with sybil nodes through encryption.We have used the random key pre distribution approach to do the same.
